# MTU COVID Form Filler

Since I have no in person classes, it always annoys me that I have to fill out this form to be able to access my online 
classes, even though I won't step foot on campus until the fall. It's especially annoying when trying to submit an
assignment last-minute, only to have to fill out a form and login again.

This extension automatically redirects you when your canvas access is blocked. It fills out the form, then brings you to
the canvas homepage.

## Installation

 Google now blocks crx extensions from outside their own store. Luckily, you can work around this by enabling developer
 mode and loading an unpacked extension.
 
Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), and click the switch in the top right to enable developer mode. Then,
drag the entire folder onto the window to install it.
